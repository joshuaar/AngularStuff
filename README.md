Random AngularJS related things

* template: boilerplate code with jquery and angular included.
* pagination: a simple pagination directive for angularjs

Opinion:
I have used Angular and found it wanting. It does solve important problems such as data binding and modularity, but it does so in an awkward and overcomplicated way.
